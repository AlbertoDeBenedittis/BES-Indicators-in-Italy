# BES-Indicators-in-Italy 🌍 

## Aim of the project 🎯
This repository has been created for the [Geospatial Analysis and Representation for Data Science](https://napo.github.io/geospatial_course_unitn/) course of the University of Trento, teached by [Diego Giuliani](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0020867/Didattica) and [Maurizio Napolitano](https://ict.fbk.eu/people/detail/maurizio-napolitano/) (a.y. 2021/2022).

The aim is to provide some insights about The fair and sustainable well-being index, the [__BES__](\href{https://www.istat.it/en/well-being-and-sustainability/the-measurement-of-well-being/bes-report) indicators in Italy and to visualize their distribution through (choroplet)maps in order to understand how the sustainability process is evolving in Italy.

## The Website 💻

The results of the analysis are summarized in a [website](https://share.streamlit.io/albertodebenedittis/besapp/main/dash.py).
The code for the website can be found at the following link: https://github.com/AlbertoDeBenedittis/BesApp

The website allows: 

* to visualiza maps and statistics for each of the 12 Bes indicator
* to navigate across the years, from 2004 to 2018, in order to see how variables have changed across the years 
* to look at the data from three different point of view: macroareas, regions and provinces 

## Repository structure 📂

All the stages of the analysis are reported in the Notebook.ipynb file
