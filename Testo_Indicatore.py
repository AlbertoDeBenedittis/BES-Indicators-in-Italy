health = '''
Health is a central element in life and an essential condition for individual well-being and prosperity of populations,
 as documented at global level by the works of the WHO Commission on
“Macroeconomics and Health (WHO 2001)”.
Health outcomes have an impact on all dimensions of the
individual life in all its different phases, modifying life conditions, behaviour, social relationships,
opportunities and prospects of individuals and, often, of their families. While age increases, the role
played by health conditions becomes increasingly important, and it is nearly exclusive among the
oldest old, when the risk of ill health is greater and the impact on quality of life of people can be
very severe. 
'''

education = '''
Education, training and the level of competences affect the well-being of individuals and open up
opportunities otherwise precluded. Education does not only have an intrinsic value but it directly
affects the well-being of people. People with higher education level have higher standards of living
and more possibilities to find work, they live longer and better because they have healthier lifestyles
and more opportunities to find jobs in a less risky. Furthermore, higher levels of education and
training are related to higher levels of access and enjoyment of goods and cultural services, and to
an active participation in the production process in the cultural and creative sectors. 
        '''

work = '''
A job well paid, reasonably secure and corresponding to competences, is a universal aspiration of
adult people and contributes significantly to the achievement of their wellbeing. It is well known
that the absence of a “good job” has a negative impact on the level of wellbeing; nevertheless a bad
distribution of work commitments which hamper the balance between working time and social and
family life can have a similar negative impact.
'''

economic = '''
Earning capacities and economic resources are not seen as an end but rather as a mean by which an
individual is able to obtain and to support a specific standard of living. Variables which can help
measuring the economic well-being include income, wealth, spending on consumer goods, housing
conditions and ownership of durable goods. As for most of the other dimensions of well-being, it is
important to go over the mere study of mean or median levels of the chosen indicators, evaluating
also the distribution among population: the judgment on the level of material well-being of a society
can change if the same overall mean income is equally divided among citizens or it is concentrated
in the hands of a few wealthy people. 
'''

social = '''
Relational networks to which individuals belong and in which they recognize themselves, represent
a fundamental resource that allows pursuing their own ends relying on additional resources
compared to the available endowments of economic and cultural capital (Bourdieu, Coleman). In
literature it is widely recognised that a generalized climate of interpersonal trust, high involvement
in associative networks and widespread civic culture increase individual wellbeing and social
cohesion, allowing a better performance, greater efficiency of public policies and a lower cost of
economic transactions. 
'''

politics = '''
The domain is based on the consideration that the trust expressed by the citizens to the
institutions, as well as civic and political participation facilitate cooperation and social cohesion
while allowing greater effi-ciency of public policies and a lower cost of transactions. Starting from
this assumption a reflection has been carried out on the information needed to measure issues
and problems - such as trust, participa-tion, equity and social cohesion - the importance of which
has been further highlighted by the current economic crisis. 
'''

security = '''
According to Sen, development can be seen as an expanding process of real freedoms enjoyed by
humans while wellbeing is the freedom to enjoy what we have reason to value (Sen, 2000). In this
sense it is certain that the subjective perception and the experience of objective safety in daily life in
Italy become of paramount importance in the construction of individual and community well-being.
Personal security is part of the foundation of individual wellbeing. Being victim of a crime can
result in economic loss, physical and/or psychological damage due to a suffered trauma. The most
important effect of criminality on well-being is the sense of vulnerability that it determines on
individuals. The fear to be victim of crime can strongly affect personal freedom, quality of life and
development of territories. Also the theme of violence is closely related to personal security and
quality of life. 
'''
subj_wll = '''
It is widely acquired in literature that collecting information on subjective aspects is of high
information and analytical value. Perceptions and evaluations affect the way people face life and
take advantage of opportunities. Subjective indicators are useful complement to the most
objectifiable indicators, because they allow evaluating the possible differences between what people
report on their perceiving regarding their satisfaction and what it is captured by statistical
observation of economic and social phenomena. The inclusion of subjective indicators allows
having a more detailed and complete overview of the overall picture related to the evaluation of
well-being [1].
The concept of well-being (which can be more generally referred to as quality of life) is organized
in literature in two macro dimensions (Michalos, 2008; Zapf, 1975, 1984):
 living conditions, with both objective and subjective aspects;
 subjective well-being.
The second dimension has a cross-sectional character, because it may be related both to specific
areas of life and to life as a whole. The “subjective well-being” domain proposed here concerns
indeed assessments and perceptions expressed directly by individuals on their life in general, but
also those related to more specific areas of life, which refer to different domains of BES. Subjective
information complete the picture of several domains, such as, for instance, the indicator on
satisfaction for family relationships which has been included in the domain Social relationships. 
'''

landscape = '''
The domain of Landscape and Cultural Heritage has been defined starting from the classical
distinction between the two dimensions of the landscape concept, proposed by Biasutti [1]. First,
“the sensible or visual landscape, consisting of what the eye can embrace, or (…) is perceivable by
all the senses; a landscape that can be reproduced by a photograph (…), as well as by a painter’s
picture, or a writer’s description”. Second, the geographical landscape, that is “an abstract
synthesis of the visible landscapes, detecting from these the elements or features that are the most
frequent over a given space which may vary in size, but is in any case bigger than that enclosed in a
single horizon”. The geographical landscape is divided into three sub-domains - urban, rural,
natural - and the first two, that are shaped by the man’s work, are considered as an integral part of
the cultural heritage. Heritage can be considered, indeed, either as a sum of items (the “heritage
properties”: museums, monuments, archaeological areas, etc.), or - in a broader sense - as the
organic whole of these elements and their respective territorial contexts. 
'''

environment = '''
An environment which is in a vital and healthy state constitutes a prerequisite to ensure authentic
well-being for all components of society. To have unpolluted water, clean air and uncontaminated
food we need a pristine environmental context, where productive and social human activities are
integrated with nature respecting its structural integrity and avoiding that the socio-economic
metabolism (the flows of matter and energy activated by man) exceeds the capacity of supply of
raw materials and absorption of residues of the natural environment. In synthesis, if our societies
are not able to live within the boundaries of a single Planet (Rockstrom’s planetary boundaries),
well-being can not be for all or lasting. 
'''

innovation = '''
Innovation and Research are an indirect determinant of well-being and the base of social and
economic progress. In the identification of suitable dimensions and the related indicators,
preference was given to those that best capture these phenomena. Moreover an effort was done in
estimating a creativity indicator, using as a proxy the percentage of employment working in cultural
and creative activities. The ability of our country to attract young people with a high level of
education was also included as indicative of propensity in a future progress. 
'''

services = '''
The link between the availability of services and citizens’ well-being is based on an interpretive
approach in which high quality public investments improve the general context in which people live
and work and their social and economic interconnections.
The choice of services to be taken as a
reference depends on two distinct considerations relating to what qualifies a service as essential in
the specific context of a policy, and what conditions must be met to define feasible targets. The
identification of services and quality of performances depends on the different level of
development, which increases the level and types of services seen as essential. For example, in
more developed contexts, the minimum set of health services refers to a wider range of treatments.
Aspects of equity and distribution, that is the connection between individual income and availability
of services, are also relevant: the inadequate availability of services particularly affects those who
do not have sufficient income conditions to resort to alternatives, while the non-availability of basic
services is in itself a factor of poverty and exclusion. In this framework poverty is understood as the
deprivation of opportunities and basic assets to which every person is entitled (nutrition, basic
education, access to health services, water services, the possibility of participation in social and
political life, ability to work, …). This implies that inadequate services directly worsen the
conditions of marginalization and exclusion, and therefore, decisive action on improving quantity
and quality of services contributes directly to the reduction of social exclusion and poverty
